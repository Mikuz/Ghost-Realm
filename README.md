# Introduction

Ghost Realm is a mobile game demo. Demo features 3D action in augmented reality. Development of the Ghost Realm has stopped. Therefore this demo is the final version of the game.

Ghost Realm was designed and developed during Game Project course in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Demo is ultimately designed for demonstration of core game concepts in the Game Connection Europe event.

Demo is made with Marmalade C++ SDK. It's tested and released on Android but nothing should limit compatibility with other platforms that Marmalade supports.

# Core concept

The game takes place in augmented reality. The default view is a real life map that player can navigate using GPS. Ghosts can be found in some area of the map.

Player fights 3D ghosts displayed in front of camera feed. Player can hit ghosts by e.g. waving their phone, drawing a spell or by yelling. Player blocks attacks e.g. by drawing a counter spell or connecting dots.

Game also includes RPG and possibly MMO elements.

Map and GPS are not implemented in this demo so the player can only stand still. Player can attack by waving their phone and block by connecting dots in the demo. RPG and MMO elements are not implemented in the demo.
